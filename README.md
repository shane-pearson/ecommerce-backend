# Description

The project was built to show how Model, View and Controllers work together. It was really to enforce what I have learned about writing code that connects these all together. To update, view and create new data.

## Usage 

This code can be used to create over again to create a new database. Once the database is built you can easily use Insomnia to view, create, update, and delete that data. 

### Installation

I was working with some provided code. From their I had to build out the models. Update how these models connect to each other, and finally build the routes from scratch the would return our required results. 

#### Credits

A lot of these concepts were taught in class. I also had to do outside research, and some tutoring to pull all the pieces together.
